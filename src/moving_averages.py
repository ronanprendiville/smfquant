# Common MA periods: 50,100, 200
# 200 "especially significant in stock trading"
# 50-day MA > 200-day MA => bullish trend ; crossover to the downside of 200-day => bearish trend
# Common EMA: 12 or 26 for short term;  50 and 200 for long-term
# Example:  If 20 DEMA decreases to a crossover with 50 DEMA => bearish
#           If 20 DEMA increases to a crossover with 50 DEMA => bullish
# DEMA general formula: DEMA = 2*EMA(n) - EMA(EMA(n)),    n = period
# Steps to calculating an EMA:
#   1.) Get SMA for the initial EMA value
#   2.) Calculate the weighting multiplier
#   3.) Calculate the EMA for each day between the initial EMA and today, using the price,
#       the multiplier, and the previous period's EMA
#    EMA general formula: EMA =
