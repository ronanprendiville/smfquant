"""
When you are ready to update the online version of the project
(called as the remote repository, as opposed to your local repository which is on your computer)
write the following commands in your terminal (found at bottom left of screen):

- "git fetch": This command will go and check what the state of the remote repository is
- "git status": This will compare your local and the remote repo and will output the status
- "git pull": If git status says something along the lines of "you are x commits behind master",
this means that your local repo is outdated and you will need to use git pull to update it.
- "git add .": Run this command and git will start tracking the changes you have made.
- "git commit -m "<insert message>" ": This will stage your changes to be uploaded. After -m insert
a short message in quotes highlighting what was done in this commit e.g git commit -m "Wrote yahoo
data retrieval function"
- "git push": This pushes your local changes to the remote repository, updating it. Once this is 
done, others will need to git pull to retrieve your changes.

Note: you may wish to only make an update to 1 file instead of the entire project. To do this
use git add <filename> as opposed to git add . - the "." implies all files.
